        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Global/Window Binding: The "this" function, if it is not closed into a certain scope will bind with the global object. In web applications, it will bind with the window, because it is the object that encompasses all. 
  2. Implicit Binding: the "this" keyword will reference the object that the dot function follows. Meaning it will attach itself to whatever object the method is calling. If the method is not calling any particular object, it will refer to the window/global object.
  3. New Binding: when a new constructor class is created--the skeleton of an object that can be instantiated, the "this" keyword will refer to the constructed object. Every new instance of the object, when preceding with "this", it will refer to the new object. 
  4. Explicit Binding: if we do not want the "this" keyword to implicitly bind to the object it is attached to and point to another object, we can explicitly bind it to another object through the .call or .apply method. This prevents the "this" keyword from assuming which object is bound to and allows the developer to determine the bind.
