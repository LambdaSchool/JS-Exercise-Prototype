    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.

          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. WINDOW/GLOBAL OBJECT BUILDING: when in the global scope, the value of "this" will be the window/console object 
    2. IMPLICIT BINDING: whenever a preceeding dot calls a function, the object before the dot will contain a funtion inside of it which is 
       called 
    3. NEW BINDING: Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance  of the object tht is created and returned by 
       the constructor function. 
    4. EXPLICIT BINDING: Whenever we use a JavaScript call or apply method, this is explicitly defined. We can override how a construtor  object
       is set by taking an object-oriented approach.
