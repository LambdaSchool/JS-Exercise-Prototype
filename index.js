    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.

          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. If the function is in the global scope, "this" inside of the function refers to the window object.
    2. If the function is called by a dot, the object before that specific dot is "this".
    3. If the function is a constructor function, when an object is created and returned by the constructor function "this" refers to that object.
    4. If call, bind, or apply is used, "this" is explicitly defined in the function.
