    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
1. In the global scope, "this" refers to the global object containing variables and functions that 
   can be accessed anywhere.
2. When followed by a dot, "this" refers to the object that is being accessed in the context of the function invocation.
3. When using a function method such as .call or .apply, "this" is explicitly passed as a parameter 
   i.e. "this" refers to the object that is passed when .call or .apply is invoked.
4. In constructor functions, When a constructor function is invoked, "this" refers to the instance of the new object that is returned 
   by the constructor function.
