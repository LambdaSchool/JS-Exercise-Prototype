  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  }
  Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
    this.isFlying = true;

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

          + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0

          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
          + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

    TASK 3
      - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
      - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. If the function is in the global scope, "this" inside of the function refers to the window object.
    2. If the function is called by a dot, the object before that specific dot is "this".
    3. If the function is a constructor function, when an object is created and returned by the constructor function "this" refers to that object.
    4. If call, bind, or apply is used, "this" is explicitly defined in the function.
